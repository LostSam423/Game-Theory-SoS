`\section{Dominant Strategies and Equilibrium}

In certain situations,  a player may have strategic options to choose for his best move, and each move would have its corresponding payoff. As the player is considered $rational$, he would prefer the move with the best possible payoff. Hence, this move is said to $dominate$ over the others. There are various forms of dominance.

\subsection{Strongly Dominant Strategy}
Let $s_i$ and $s'_i$ be two strategies for player $i$, and let $S_{-i}$ be the set of all possible strategy profile for the other players, then $s_i$ is said to $strongly$ $dominate$ over $s'_i$ if, $$u_i(s_i, s_{-i})> u_i(s'_i, s_{-i}) \forall s_{-i} \in S_{-i}$$
Hence, it is obvious that player $i$ will always prefer strategy $s_i$ over $s'_i$.

\subsection{Very Weakly Dominant Strategy}

We say that strategy $s_i$ is \textit{weakly dominant} over $s'_i$ if, $$u_i(s_i, s_{-i}) \geq u_i(s'_i, s_{-i}) \forall s_{-i} \in S_{-i}$$
Here, the dominance is not strict.\\
There also are other kinds of dominant strategies that lie between the above two extremes., which we would talk about later in the report.
\subsection{Dominance and Equilibrium}

\subsubsection{Strongly Dominant Strategy Equilibrium}

A strategy profile $(s^*_1, \dots , s^*_n)$ is called a \textit{strongly dominant strategy equilibrium} of a game, if $\forall i = 1, 2, \dots , n$ the strategy $s^*_i$ is a strongly dominant strategy for player $i$. 

\subsubsection{Very Weakly Dominant Strategy Equilibrium}

A strategy profile $(s^*_1, \dots , s^*_n)$ is called a \textit{very weakly dominant strategy equilibrium} of a game, if $\forall i = 1, 2, \dots , n$ the strategy $s^*_i$ is a very weakly dominant strategy for player $i$.
